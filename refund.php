                **CONZURA SOFT SOLUTIONS OPC PRIVATE LIMITED** believes in helping its customers as far as
                possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-4">
                <li>
                    **Cancellations** will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order.
                    However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
                    vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    CONZURA SOFT SOLUTIONS OPC PRIVATE LIMITED does not accept cancellation requests for
                    perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However, **refund/replacement** can be made if the customer
                    establishes that the quality of product delivered is not good.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In case of receipt of **damaged or defective items** please report the same to our Customer Service team.
                    The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his
                    own end. This should be reported within **7 Days** of receipt of the products. In case you feel that the
                    product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of
